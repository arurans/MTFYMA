The implementations are mainly explained as text before the relevant numerical method. \n",

    "First we are going to define the Hénon-Heiles system for each of the methods. The reason for the specific implementation choices will be explained below, but in short terms there are 4 different implementations. They are all designed to take in values by passing-by-reference instead of calculating and returning the values. This way we save both memory space and execution time. The only exception is the system for the library method, which I couldn't make work with that method, and is therefore quite slow compared to the implemented methods. It is also slow because the scipy-library will not allow the use of \"@jit(nopython = True)\" function decorator from the numba library, which compiles a given function."

This method uses the Dormand-Prince pair formulas, and is a Runge-Kutta method of order 5 ([reference[2]](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.RK45.html)). For a small time interval I will solve the Hénon-Heiles system with all the numerical methods implemented. The step size will vary logarithmically from $10^{-3.9}$ to $1$. At each step size the last values for each numerical method will be compared to the library method, which will use a relative tolerance of approximately $2.22 \\cdot 10^{-14}$, which is the lowest possible tolerance allowed by the library. The difference between the two methods will determine our error, which we will see might be problematic for smaller step sizes. However this works excellently for relatively small step sizes, and for methods with lower order of convergence. As we will observe the only method with a problem for these values is Kutta's method, because of its high accuracy. \n",

The problem is that we can always choose a time interval such that the energy of the systems calculated with the Shampine-Bogacki method and Kutta's method will drift. When we deal with very long time intervals, it most likely will not be practial to use such small time steps.

The Shampine-Bogacki and Kutta's method are suited for such calculations, especially Kutta's method, which only uses a bit more time and computational power than the Shampine-bogacki method, but in return is much more accurate.

Symplectic methods conserves the Hamiltonian properties of ordinary differential equations \\[3 p.187\\] (we can consider the solution of a differential equation to be a transformation of the initial conditions \\[1\\], and symplectic transformations conserves these properties). Symplectic methods does not conserve the energy of the actual Hamiltonian, but rather a perturbed energy of the perturbed Hamiltonian. \n",

According to the paper: \"When the vector field is Hamiltonian on either a symplectic vectorspace or a Poisson vector space with constant Poisson structure,  the map determined by this discretization has a conserved modified Hamiltonian\\[...\\]\". Because the Hénon-Heiles system seems to preserve some form of the energy (by oscillating around the actual energy, similar to the result calculated by the Störmer-Verlet method), it might be reasonable to conclude that our problem satisfies these conditions. This implies that it is not always appropriate to use Kahan's method when dealing with long time frames. We first have to check if the conditions are met.

    "$T$ is the time interval, and $h$ is the time step. We know that the Poincaré-cut for the Hénon-Heiles system with $H_0 = \\frac{1}{12}$ should be a closed curve\\[1\\]. We can observe from $\\bf{\\text{Figure 14}}$ that Kahan's method and Störmer-Verlet method manages to do this for a time interval of $T = 10^6$s and step size $h = 0.1$s. Kutta's method manages to preserve this property to some degree, but is much better at it when $T = 10^5$s and $h = 0.01$s. It is apparent from the figure that the Shampine-Bogacki method does not fare well with long time intervals and large time steps. The fact that the curve is closed when $T = 10^5$s and $h = 0.01$s, supports our results from problem 2, that Shampine-Bogacki method is only accurate for lower time intervals, unless the step size is extremely small. Because Kutta's method is of higher order, it would take a larger time interval to observe the same, but we should expect the same results at some point. "

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we have discussed the properties of various numerical methods, by studying their application on the Hénon-Heiles system. We have noticed that rate of convergence is not the only property to consider when choosing a numerical method when solving a problem. For problems dealing with shorter time intervals, methods such as Kutta's method or the Shampine-Bogacki method, will yield more accurate results. If we, however, were to study systems in larger time frames, methods such as Störmer-Verlet method and Kahan's method would be preferable. "
