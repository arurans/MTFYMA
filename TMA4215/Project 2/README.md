# Nummat-prosjekt

Numerical Mathematics Project 2. With Inga Holt and Ingvild Ødegård.

Focus on composite Bézier curves, and optimization of Bézier curves. 


The python-code part of the project is in the "python"-folder (not fully up to date). The gradientDescent.py file is especially messy (lots of last minute edits), and should be revisited (but it works:)).

**Gifs:**

    1. "entireBezier.gif" visualizes the construction of a 4-th degree Bézier curve interpolating 5 points. 
    2. "bezier.gif" visualizes the construction of a 4-th degree Bézier curve interpolating 5 points, up until t = 1/3

**Plots:**

    1. GS: The letter S with gradient descent applied to it
    2. noGS: The letter S as handdrawn, with no gradient descent applied to it
